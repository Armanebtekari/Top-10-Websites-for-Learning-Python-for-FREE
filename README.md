 <h2>About Project👨‍💻👊🏼</h2>
 
Hello guys, if you want to learn Python in 2022 and looking for some Free Websites and free Python tutorials then you have come to the right place. Earlier, I shared the best Python programming courses and Python projects which you can do to learn Python.😊👨‍💻

 <h2>About Python🤔</h2>

Python is currently the world’s #1 programming language and its popularity is growing every passing day, thanks to Data Science and Machine learning and awesome Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow.

So, if you are also thinking to learn Python in 2022 or already started coding with Python but still looking for some free resources then you have come to the right place.

  <h2>Getting Start👨‍💻🏼👏</h2>
 
Today, I will share popular websites to learn Python coding for free and free Python coding tutorials from sites like Google, Microsoft, Udemy, Coursera, Educative, FreeCodeCamp, CodeCademy, Javarevisited, and much more.😉😊

But before that, if you are here then let me first congratulate you for making the right decision to learn Python programming language, the king of programming languages.🎉

Top 10 Websites to Learn Python Programming for Beginners
Here you will find some of the best places to learn Python for free, I have handpicked these resources with a couple of Python experts.

I have purposefully chosen as few resources as possible but still with some options. Just in case you have any other useful Python websites which teach Python development for free then feel free to suggest them.🙏🙌


 <h2>Now let's introduce 10 of the best Python training sites👊🏼👨‍💻</h2>
 
### 1- Google💣

If you don’t know, Google also has an excellent set of Python tutorials for beginners, known as Google’s Python class. This is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience and who want to learn Python. The course includes written tutorials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding.

The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the next exercises, which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections.

Google itself uses Python for a lot of its projects. And, these materials are generally used within Google to teach Python to people who have just started coding or have little programming experience.

The best part of this material is that lecture videos are available on Youtube. Hence you don’t need any other account. It also teaches you to set up your own Python development environment, which does produce initial challenge but great for the long run.

### 2- Udemy🎈

Udemy is one of the popular online course platforms, which probably has the biggest collection of free online courses on earth. I like Udemy because you can virtually find a course on anything you want to learn and that too for free.

Unlike CodeCademy, you don’t need any subscription, you just need to create a free account, and then you can enroll in free Python courses. Most of the instructors keep their course free when they first launch them so that they can get some traction, reviews, and social proofs.

But, there are also good quality Python courses that are entirely free like Introduction To Python Programming and Python for Beginners. You can join them to learn Python 3. Here are some of my favorite free classes to learn Python in depth.

### 3- CodeCademy💡

If you like interactive learning, then there is no better place than CodeCademy. They first teach you theory in as few words as possible and then ask you to write code online using that concept. The best thing is you don’t need to do any setup like installing Python on your machine.

You can run Python code right from your browser. Another good thing is that you don’t need to write a complete program until you are ready. You need to make small changes and execute them. This is a great and fun way to learn Python programming.

I have learned JavaScript, Java, Python, and Linux using their interactive platform. Earlier they were completely free but not they have a freemium model where some of their lessons or a course will only be available for paid members.

Currently, their Learn Python 2 course is free, and Python 3 course is only available for paid members. If you can afford and appreciate CodeCademy, by all means, join Codecademy PRO, but if you can’t just start with their Python 2 course, it’s perfect for beginners having no coding experience.

### 4- Educative💻

This is another website to learn Python coding for FREE in 2022. If you don’t know Educative is a text-based interactive platform that allows you to learn and code from your browser.

You can learn the concept and just code in the next line without worrying about downloading the necessary software and setting up your development environment. This is the biggest advantage for any beginner learning any programming language as most of them are stuck in this setup part.

If you want to learn Python in 2022 then this course is the perfect place to start. The course begins by exploring the basic building blocks before moving on to higher-level concepts such as functions and loops.

Fun quizzes and coding challenges will accompany you along the way to help enforce all the concepts covered in the course.

### 5- Coursera✨

If you want to learn from the world’s leading universities without paying a single cent then Coursera is the best website to go. It offers online courses taught at reputed universities like Stanford, INSEAD, NUS (National University of Singapore), and many more.

On top of that, it’s has one of the most popular free courses to learn Python — Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python).

This course will teach you Python 3 from ground zero. You don’t need any prior programming experience as you will learn in the course. More than 850,000 students have already enrolled in this course and learned how to program, now it’s your chance to benefit from it.

The course is also part of the Python for Everybody Specialization on Coursera, which contains 4 more classes to learn Python in-depth:

 * 1- Python Data Structure
 * 2- Using Python on Access Web Data
 * 3- Using Database with Python
 * 4- Capstone Project: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
 
All courses are free-to-audit, which means you can join them free and learn. But, you cannot participate in assignments and quizzes and won’t get any certification until you pay.

### 6- Microsoft [edX] 🥇
If Google has a Python class, then how come Microsoft can be left behind? Well, it also has a free Python course on Edx, another popular online portal for free education.

This course is called Introduction to Python: Absolute Beginner, which is a free course to learn Python, taught by Eric Camplin, Senior Content Developer.

This course will teach you Python in Jupyter Notebooks, an online browser-based coding editor for Python, which means you don’t need to install Python. It’s a 5-week course with 3 to 4 hours of study every week.

This course is also part of the Microsoft Professional Program in Entry-Level Software Development, which is also free. You only need to pay when you need a certification. Something which you can add to your resume or LinkedIn profile as shown below:

### 7- FreeCodeCamp [Youtube] 🔥
This is another awesome website to learn tech skills for FREE. They also have an amazing Youtube channel where you will find a lot of free online courses and this free Python course is one of them.

This course will give you a full introduction to all of the core concepts in python. Follow along with the videos and you’ll be a python programmer in no time! You can watch it on Youtube for free, here is a table of content
