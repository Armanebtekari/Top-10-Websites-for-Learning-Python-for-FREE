Top 10 Websites to Learn Python Programming for Beginners
Here you will find some of the best places to learn Python for free, I have handpicked these resources with a couple of Python experts.

 <h2>Now let's introduce 10 of the best Python training sites👊🏼👨‍💻</h2>
 
### 1- Google

If you don’t know, Google also has an excellent set of Python tutorials for beginners, known as Google’s Python class. This is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience and who want to learn Python. The course includes written tutorials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding.

The first exercises work on basic Python concepts like strings and lists, building up to the next exercises, which are full programs dealing with text files, processes, and http connections.

Google itself uses Python for a lot of its projects. And, these materials are generally used within Google to teach Python to people who have just started coding or have little programming experience.

The best part of this material is that lecture videos are available on Youtube. Hence you don’t need any other account. It also teaches you to set up your own Python development environment, which does produce initial challenge but great for the long run.
